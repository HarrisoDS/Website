        <p>Here at CAMHS we strive to help each of our patients through whatever they may be growing through, 
            this is done by prescribing them to multiple weeklong assessments and therapy in which our croakfastic staff use their high level skills to determine a patient's needs.
            <br> <br>Emotional conflict is exactly what CAMHS aims to demolish. No bad emotions? No bad thoughts, no bad actions!<br><br>
            We centre our sessions around CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), where we focus on how our emotions affect our thoughts, which affect our actions, which affect our emotions.<br><br>
            The recent opening of our new building, located in Oskea, allows the communities in that area to get the help they may require. In addition to celebrating this new opening,
            a special few individuals within Oskea will be chosen to receive a free tour and have their first session FREE!<br><br>
            We are excited to see and greet our first guests to arrive at the grand opening of CAMHS on the 9th May, 2025. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>-Polliwogs<br>
            In association with F.R.O.GÂ® (Ferocious, Ribbiting, Operations, Guild)
